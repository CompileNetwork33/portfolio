                        I'm currently pursuing a B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering, with a strong foundation in
                        C,
                        C++,
                        and web development. I'm actively learning Python and expanding my skills in data structures,
                        problem-solving, and creative coding. I enjoy building projects that combine technical depth
                        with
                        visual
                        storytelling, and I'm always exploring new tools and ideas to grow as a developer.
                        eyond the code, I'm curious about animation and visual storytelling, experimenting with tools
                        like Blender to bring ideas to life. I believe in learning by doing, and I'm constantly seeking
                        opportunities to grow through hands-on projects, collaboration, and feedback. Whether it's a
                        console-based game, a responsive website, or a quirky animation loop, I aim to make my work
                        reflect both technical depth and personal flair.

                        Want to add a short tagline too? Something like:
                        "Code with logic. Create with imagination."
                        Or
                        "Turning ideas into interactive experiences."
                        Let me know if you'd like a version tailored for LinkedIn or GitHub too!
